              "Battery capacity (mAh) affects how long the phone lasts. But screen size, refresh rate, and optimization also matter. Example: A 6000mAh phone with poor optimization might last shorter than a 4000mAh phone with good power management.",
            recommendation:
              "Choose at least 4500mAh with good software optimization for real-life endurance. Look for phones with adaptive refresh rate and efficient processors."

              "Display quality involves resolution, refresh rate, brightness, and panel type (LCD, OLED, AMOLED). Example: A 90Hz AMOLED display might look better than a 120Hz LCD due to better contrast and color reproduction, despite lower refresh rate.",
            recommendation:
              "Prioritize AMOLED/OLED for better colors and true blacks. Aim for at least 90Hz refresh rate and 1000+ nits peak brightness for outdoor visibility."

            recommendation:
              "Aim for at least 6GB for normal use, 8GB for heavy multitasking. Consider 12GB only if you're a power user running demanding apps simultaneously."
